# Power-BI-DashBoard
 


### I have analyzed the data and created a dashboard using Power BI that shows the customer churn situation in a clear and concise way.



### Here are some of the insights and suggestions that I have derived from the data. Please let me know your feedback on them.


* The customer churn rate last month was 27%, which means that out of 7043 customers, 1869 left the company.


* The length of the contract and the tenure of the customer are key factors in predicting the churn behavior. Customers who have a monthly contract and a lower tenure are more likely to switch to other providers.


* Gender does not seem to have a significant impact on the churn decision. However, senior citizens are less likely to churn than non-senior citizens.


* Customers who use Fibre Optic internet service have a higher churn rate than those who use other types of internet service. The payment method also influences the churn decision, with Electronic check being the most common among the churned customers.

  ### Suggestions

*  The company should consider extending the basic contract plan from one month to three or six months. This would encourage customers to stay longer with the company and reduce the churn rate.


* The company should provide basic services such as device protection, tech support, and online security as part of their standard package. These services can increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, and prevent them from switching to competitors.
